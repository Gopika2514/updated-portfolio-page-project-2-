## Your Task

provide links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and resume. In the work section, list at least two projects with a title, deployment URL, GitHub URL, and a screenshot. 

Moving to your GitHub profile, add a profile picture, a bio statement, a link to your deployed portfolio, and your email address. Also, follow a few developers and pin at least two repositories. Each pinned project should have a README containing project descriptions, screenshots, and links to deployed applications.
